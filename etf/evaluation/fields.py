Consider, for example, a situation where business-as-usual results in 5% of people achieving some desired outcome and the novel intervention results in 15% of people achieving it. An absolute measure would be a prevalence difference of 10 percentage points. A relative measure would be a prevalence ratio of 3 : 1. Readers will typically get a clearer picture of the impact of the intervention from the absolute measure than the relative measure.",

            "For binary outcomes, a suitable absolute measure is often the 'prevalence difference': the difference between the proportions of people achieving the outcome in the intervention group and the control group. A relative measure for binary outcomes would be the 'prevalence ratio'.",
            "For numerical outcomes, suitable absolute measures often include differences in mean levels of the outcome between the groups. If the outcome is measured as a quantity that is meaningful in practice, the differences between mean levels of this quantity will also typically be something meaningful. (For example, if the outcome is each person's income in £ per week, then it will be meaningful and interpretable to see that weekly incomes are on average £x higher in the intervention group than the control group.)",

It is very helpful to know whether there is a large or small amount of uncertainty around that number. Are the data relatively compatible with values in the region £20 to £180, or only compatible with values from £95 to £105?",
            "Such intervals can also be used to create a summary interpretation of the effectiveness of an intervention, if such an interpretation is required. An interval that excludes zero (for example, +£10 to +£30) can be interpreted as the intervention being superior, whereas one that spans zero (for example, -£10 to +£20) is inconclusive.",

        "impact_interpretation_type": [
            "Intervals such as confidence intervals can be used to form an interpretation of findings. This will typically take the form of assessing whether the interval spans some null value or not. The null value is normally 0 (zero) for absolute measures and 1 (one) for relative measures. For example, if a confidence interval for the difference in mean weekly earnings between the intervention group and control group runs from +£5 to +£10, an interpretation of the interval might be that the intervention is superior for increasing earnings. If, however, the interval ran from -£5 to +£20, the interpretation might be that the findings are inconclusive (although both might be associated with the same point estimate for the difference).",
            "Hypothesis testing methods are often based on the calculation of p-values and the rejection of a null hypothesis if the p-value falls below some threshold (traditionally 0.05). These methods should generally be avoided as they are commonly misinterpreted.",

            "Particular caution should be exercised over subgroup analyses that are specified after the data have been seen. A common mistake in studies is that if an intervention appears unsuccessful for the population as a whole, researchers can go 'fishing' through the data to find any subset of people it does work for.
