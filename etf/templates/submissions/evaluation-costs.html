            <p>Another option is to break the costs down by **types of activity**, for example adding cost items for 'Evaluation fieldwork', 'Evaluation analysis', etc.</p>

            <p>If you just want to record the **total cost** of the evaluation, enter 'Whole evaluation' as the item and then the total cost as the associated cost.</p>
